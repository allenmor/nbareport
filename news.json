The NFL and college football season kicks into high gear, and the MLB season culminates with the postseason. Take advantage of all the football and baseball action by signing up with the <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/betting/sportsbooks/fanduel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FanDuel promo code</a> offer and redeeming the $1,000 No Sweat First Bet deal.  </p>\n<div class=\"gdcg-oplist\" data-gdcg_rankid=\"1179\"> </div>\n<p>The <strong>FanDuel promo code</strong> offer protects the first wager after signing up, ensuring reimbursement of up to $1,000 if your qualifying bet doesn't win. The refund is paid out within 72 hours, and bettors have 14 days to reinvest the site credit. The $1,000 No Sweat First Bet welcome offer has a few key advantages, including the straightforward redemption process.</p>\n<p>Click the link on this page, sign up, deposit at least $10, and commit to a qualifying wager. If you prefer accessing picks on <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/266131/Best-Sports-Betting-Apps-2022-Legal-Online-Sportsbook-Apps\">sports betting apps</a>, download the FanDuel mobile app and sign up on it instead. The <strong>FanDuel sportsbook promo code</strong> offer is available on the mobile app.  </p>\n<h2>FanDuel Promo Code Has It Factor Bettors Love </h2>\n<p>The $1,000 No Sweat First Bet signup bonus is a risk-free bet similar to several prominent risk-free bets offered by top online sportsbooks. However, one aspect of the <strong>FanDuel promo code </strong>offer makes it a superstar welcome bonus.</p>\n<div class=\"gdcg-oplist\" data-gdcg_rankid=\"1179\"> </div>\n<p>The online sportsbook doesn't require you to invest the site credit on one follow-up bet, instead providing the freedom to make as many bets as you want. For example, say your $500 qualifying bet loses. You can use the $500 on as many bets as you wish, offering ample opportunities to increase your bankroll. Just specify the amount you want to redeem, and lock in the bet.</p>\n<p>The freedom to invest the site credit on an unlimited number of follow-up bets puts even more emphasis on the qualifying wager. The more you deposit and stake, the higher the redemption if your bet loses. Imagine having $1,000 in site credit to use on as many follow-up bets as you like. Remember, you have 14 days to reinvest every dollar of site credit before it expires.</p>\n<h2>FanDuel Promo Code: Refer 10 Friends, Earn $1000 </h2>\n<p>The refer-a-friend <strong>FanDuel promo code</strong> offer does things a little differently than most betting sites. You can earn up to $1,000 by referring 10 friends, though the site credit is split between the online sportsbook and casino. So, you can earn $500 worth of online sportsbook credit and $500 in casino credit if you refer 10 friends.</p>\n<div class=\"gdcg-oplist\" data-gdcg_rankid=\"1179\"> </div>\n<p>In addition, both the referrer and the referred benefit from this offer. Send each friend a referral link, which they must click on to activate the bonus. Both parties receive a $50 online sportsbook free-bet token when the new joiner clicks on the link, signs up, deposits, and wagers at least $10.</p>\n<p>The site credit is deposited into the referred and the referrer's accounts within 72 hours.</p>\n<p>The referred and referrer earn an additional $50 casino token if the new joiner invests at least $10 on any casino game.</p>\n<p>Convince 10 friends to sign up by clicking on your referral links, and you can earn the $1,000 maximum, split evenly between sportsbook and casino credit.</p>\n<div class=\"gdcg-oplist\" data-gdcg_rankid=\"5\"> </div>",

               "description": "<p>While on The Dave Pasch Podcast, Damian Lillard was asked about his future with the Portland Trail Blazers. Lillard was clear when asked if he hopes to be with Portland for his entire career.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I do (plan on being a Blazer for life),\" Lillard said. \"I've had my share of people saying 'Man, you got to get out of there! You've got to do this; you've got do to that.' But I'm the type of person that I'm never going to be marching to the beat of nobody else's drum.\"</p>\n<p>Lillard went on to say he follows his heart. He added that he's loyal to the Trail Blazers organization.</p>\n<p>\"I'm gonna always do what I feel like is in my best interest and that I really feel in my heart,\" Lillard said. \"I've said this on many different occasions, they call it 'He's being loyal!' and 'Loyalty this, loyalty that' and I'm like, I'm naturally a loyal person but I do have a level of loyalty to the organization. But this loyalty that they're talking about is ultimately to who I am as a person. I'm being loyal to who I am and not getting beside myself because I'm somebody that, I believe what I believe.\"</p>\n<p>Lillard said he knows many think he needs to leave Portland to win a championship. But he believes that he can win at the highest levels with the Trail Blazers.</p>\n<p>\"I think I can get it done. Now, everybody else might say 'There's no way the Blazers will ever win. They need to do this, they need to do that.' But that's just not how I feel about the situation,\" Lillard said. \"I feel like we'll have a chance to win, I feel like that moment is going to come, I feel like that opportunity is going to come. And that's that.\"</p>",

               "description": "<p>After trading Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, the Utah Jazz are exploring the trade market for the remaining veterans on their roster. Utah has talked trades with rival teams involving Bojan Bogdanovic, Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Rudy Gay and Malik Beasley.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Jazz have held ongoing talks with the Los Angeles Lakers surrounding Bojan Bogdanovic. The veteran forward averaged 18.1 points on 45/39/86 shooting splits a season ago.</p>\n<p>Utah and Los Angeles have already linked up for one deal this offseason. The Lakers sent Talen Horton-Tucker and Stanley Johnson to the Jazz in exchange for Patrick Beverley. Landing Bogdanovic would go a long way towards adding depth to the Lakers rotation.</p>\n<p>The challenge is Los Angeles may find it difficult to match salary in a trade for Bogdanovic. In part, that may be why Utah isn't close to trading Bogdanovic at this time.</p>",
